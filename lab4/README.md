  1.  I have Created the CRC and attached in the attchment. It consists of Customer, Queue Manager, Table Manager 
      and Table as a Class. 
      Customer --> Provide customer information. 
                   Reply to the message with Confirm or Leave. 
      Queue Manager --> Look for availability of tables with Table Manager. 
                        Reply to customer with the option accepted or in a waitlist. 
      Table Manager --> Provide information to Queue Manager about avalability of tables. 
                        Keep records of each table. 
      Table --> Provide table information like its capacity.

 2.  These classes has a certain responsibilities. Once each object performs its responsibility the next object will be 
     ready for its responsibility. That's why, I chose chain-of responsiblity for this problem. 
     I have attached the complete explanation for the process in the attachment.
