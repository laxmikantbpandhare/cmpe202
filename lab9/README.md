### Burger Charges Calculation

* For implementation of Lambda function with strategy pattern, I have considered the price printing of different types of burgers.

* I have considered below types of burger for calculation of it's price.

  - Organic Bason
  - Quinoa
  - In a Bowl
  - Organic and Antibiotic Free Beef 
  - House made Vegan Veggie
 
* The intial price is set to 0$ and whenever each function gets called during printing, its value get added by the value of the burger.

* There were two implementation for this process, without Lambda and with lambda function.

* For Lambda process, added lambda functions and printed the value of each burger accordingly.

## Comparision

* Lambda function helped to reduce the code.
* No need to add additional classes for each and every type of burger.
